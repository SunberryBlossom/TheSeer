# The Seer
A C# Console app that generates randomized card readings.
### Features

- Can use several different spreads and explains each cards meaning and recommended actions.

### Installation
- Download the V1.0.0 release from the [Releases](https://github.com/SunberryBlossom/Tarot/releases)
- You only need the `TheSeer.exe` file to run the application.

### Usage
- Either double-click the `TheSeer.exe` file or run it from the command line.
- Follow the on-screen prompts to receive your card reading.
- Enjoy your reading!

### Notes on V1.0.0
- This is the initial release of The Seer. I developed this version before I started my .NET fullstack studies, so the code may not follow best practices or be optimally structured.

## Future Plans - V2.0.0
- I am currently working on a V2.0.0 version of The Seer as part of my .NET fullstack studies.
- The V2.0.0 version will include:
  - Improved code structure and optimization (following OOP).
  - Additional features and spreads for card readings such as different decks and more detailed interpretations.
  - Somewhat more polished user interface with different pages for different functionalities.
  - A Wiki page for other developers to understand the codebase better.
  - Possibly database integration for saving user readings.
