Hey! Thank you for trying out one of the first things I ever created in C# (not counting learning labs and "hello world":s)!

The code is most likely extremely suboptimal since I am but a humble beginner, but it is a pretty neat little program regardless.

The motivation behind making it was due to laziness, ironically; I did not wanna bring my tarot-deck with me going between my own, my
girlfriend's and my mom's place.

I might go back to this to make more optimized versions in the future as I learn more about C# and coding in general, but no real promises rn.

Enjoy, and if you have feedback, let me know on Github or by email (elviramariesdotter@gmail.com).
